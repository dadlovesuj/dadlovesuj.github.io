## Your last name is JAIN
I gave you your last name since I also am JAIN and I am your Dad and love you more than anything!
## JAIN means you are nice person who loves people, animals and all living things
Jain people believe everyone is special and that animals are our friends!
## Even though people hurt us, we should not hurt others
We don't hurt people, and we don't hurt or eat animals
## JAIN is also your religion
Jain's like peace and being friends and do not hurt people and animals
## You have the right to be JAIN since that is your identity
No grownup can take that away from you and no grown up should EVER give you meat to eat-- animals are friends to Jain people not food
## Your name is UJVAL JAIN
Your nickname is UJ but you don't have any other names that anyone can call you
# :-)
## You have TWO parents, your DAD and your MOM
Even though lots of adults love you, no one else is your parent and NO ONE else is your Dad, Father or Parent!
## You are an American citizen--- go USA!!!
That means you are American from the USA and NOT from China, India, a world citizen, or from anywhere else!
## God bless AMERICA, your home sweet home
You live in America and no where else!
## It is important to learn about other people, they are our friends
BUT you are an American boy, born in the USA, and NO ONE can take your USA identity away from you since that is your RIGHT!
## DAD gave you your USA citizenship since Dad is a USA citizen just like you!
And Dad LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING!!!
# :-)
## You can talk to DAD anytime you WANT
Just ask a grownup to call 917-719-0915 or email dad@dadlovesuj.com
## Say I want to talk to my DAD right now please!
You may be small, but grownups will listen since those are your RIGHTS!
# :-)
## Your school is UNIS which means that it is part of the UN
Grownups who are a part of UN and UNIS care alot about rules and your RIGHTS and they have to follow the rules
## The UN has rules for kids that grownups have to follow
In fact it is your RIGHTS!!!
## The rules are called "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child"
or UNCRC for short
## It means that all the grown-ups should follow the UNCRC rules and help kids like you
Those are big words, but you can see it in pictures here: https://www.unicef.org/rightsite/files/rightsforeverychild.pdf
# :-)
# Those UNCRC Rules mean you have the RIGHT to your 1) OWN NAME and 2) OWN NATIONALITY 3) your JAIN religion and to speak to your 4) DAD!!!
# :-)
## Your name is UJVAL JAIN, you are a USA CITIZEN, you are of the JAIN religion who don't eat meat, and your DAD wants to talk to you at 917-719-0915 or dad@dadlovesuj.com
And your Dad loves you more than anything!!!
## Grown-ups will help you since those are your RIGHTS!
See, even grownups have to follow the rules since those are your RIGHTS
# :-)
## You have rights and you have a voice that grown-ups will listen to, but you also have a special JOB to do
You have to go to school and learn but you also have a bigger job
## You are very special and you have alot more than most of the other kids
You have so many toys, you have so many people to love you, you have so much
## You are a very good boy!
Sometimes you might not follow the rules and get in trouble, or an adult might yell at you-- but you are still a good boy
## But just being good for yourself is NOT enough
That because you are special
## You have to be good for other people too since that is your special job and you have magic SUPER-HERO POWERS!
Your job is to use your magic super hero powers to help others
## Your name UJVAL means light, and you have the superpower of LIGHT!
Your superpower is also your job
# By helping other people you will shine your LIGHT across the WORLD
Helping others is a real magic superpower!
# :-)
# The ONLY way bad things can ever happen is when GOOD people do NOTHING
Even when bad things happen YOU are still a good boy and Dad will always love you
## You will NOT do NOTHING since your job is to use your super-powers and make the world better
That can be if someone is being mean, if someone is not telling the truth, if someone is being hurtful, or many other things you will slowly learn as you grow up
## When you see something BAD, it is time for you to SHINE your UJVAL super-light
You have to help and do your job to make it right!
## But why should YOU help?
Maybe you should do nothing and wait for someone else to help?
# You must always help because you are SPECIAL, and it is your JOB and super power!
That is why you are UJVAL
# :-)

# Your Dad will love you always!
# :-)
# Now repeat after me:
## Om Jai Jai Namo stu Namo stu Namo stu
## (1) Namo ari han ta nam
## (2) Namo sid ah nam
## (3) Namo aya ri ha nam
## (4) Namo uva jaya nam
## (5) Namo lo ay sav ay sa hu nam
# Those are magic words
## The magic words will always protect you
The magic words have Dad's love and magic super powers in them
## When you were born, you gave Dad magic super powers since you made Dad into a Dad!
When you were born Dad told you those magic words in your ear when Dad first held you!
## Those magic words were the first words you ever heard!
If you miss your Dad just say "I love you Daddy"
## Your Dad is always listening to you and watching over you and will hear you-- even from far away
Then your Dad will appear inside your heart!
## Those are really magic words!
