Bubbe, Baba, Chacha, Badi Bua, Chote Bua, Kakha, Kakhi and Chutku also love you soooooo much!
## Your last name is JAIN
I gave you your last name since I am your Dad and love you more than anything!
## JAIN means you are nice person who loves people, animals and all living things
Jain people believe everyone is special and that animals are our friends!
## Even though people hurt us, we should not hurt others
We don't hurt people, and we don't hurt or eat animals
## JAIN is also your religion
Jain's like peace and being friends and do not hurt people and animals
## You have the right to be JAIN since that is your identity
No grownup can take that away from you and no grown up should EVER give you meat to eat-- animals are friends to Jain people not food
## Your name is UJVAL JAIN
Your nickname is UJ but you don't have any other names that anyone can call you
## :-)
## You have TWO parents, your DAD and your MOM
Even though lots of adults love you, no one else is your parent and NO ONE else is your Dad, Father or Parent!
## You are an American citizen--- go USA!!!
That means you are American from the USA and NOT from China, India, a world citizen, or from anywhere else!
## It is important to learn about other people, they are our friends
BUT you are an American boy, born in the USA, and NO ONE can take your USA identity away from you since that is your RIGHT!
## DAD gave you your USA citizenship since Dad is a USA citizen just like you!
And Dad LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING!!!
## :-)
## You can talk to DAD anytime you WANT
Just ask a grownup to call 917-719-0915 or email dad@dadlovesuj.com
## Say I want to talk to my DAD right now please!
You may be small, but grownups will listen since those are your RIGHTS!

## Your school is UNIS which means that it is part of the UN
Grownups who are a part of UN and UNIS care alot about rules and your RIGHTS and they have to follow the rules
## The UN has rules for kids that grownups have to follow
In fact it is your RIGHTS!!!
## The rules are called "The Universal Declaration of the Rights of The Child"
Those are big words, but you can see it in pictures here: https://www.unicef.org/rightsite/files/rightsforeverychild.pdf
#
# Those Rules mean you have the RIGHT to your 1) OWN NAME and 2) OWN NATIONALITY 3) your JAIN religion and to speak to your 4) DAD!!!
## Your name is UJVAL JAIN, you are a USA CITIZEN, you are JAIN religion who don't eat meat, and your DAD wants to talk to you at 917-719-0915 or dad@dadlovesuj.com

See, even grownups have to follow the rules since those are your RIGHTS
# Your Dad will love you always!
# Now repeat after me:
## Om Jai Jai Namo stu Namo stu Namo stu
## Namo ari han ta nam
## Namo sid ah nam
## Namo aya ri ha nam
## Namo uva jaya nam
## Namo lo ay sav ay sa hu nam
# Those are magic words
## The magic words will always protect you
## The magic words have Dad's love and magic super powers in them
## When you were born, you gave Dad magic super powers since you made Dad into a Dad!
## When you were born Dad told you those magic words in your ear when Dad first held you!
## Those magic words were the first words you ever heard!
## If you miss your Dad just say "I love you Daddy"
## Your Dad will hear it and say the magic words
## Then your Dad will appear inside your heart!
## Those are really magic words!
